### My Top 3 Strengths

* Adaptability
  * I have been a classroom teacher for about a decade, and I have always considered adaptability as one of my strenghs. `"Ability to cope with change positively and constructively"`, as a teacher we never know which students/coworkers will show up on any given day. So if the plan for that day depend upon someone who is not present, we have to be able to adapt and produce a new lesson plan that is still engaging and knowledge building.  "Actively seeks information to tests assumptions". "Shifts approach in response to the demands of a changing situation"
