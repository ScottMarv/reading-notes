# Reading Notes: Porfessional Competencies

### My Top 3 Strengths

* Adaptability
  * I have been a classroom teacher for about a decade, and I have always considered adaptability as one of my strenghs. `Ability to cope with change positively and constructively`, as a teacher we never know which students/coworkers will show up on any given day. So if the plan for that day depend upon someone who is not present, we have to be able to adapt and produce a new lesson plan that is still engaging and knowledge building.
  *`Actively seeks information to tests assumptions`In my current profession we use things called "formative assessments" to gauge how well the students are grasping the material. These can be done on the fly to modify the activity to maximize the learning of the students.
  *`Shifts approach in response to the demands of a changing situation` From year to year, I often use the same curriculum, but I end up having to modify the majority of the activities in order to best suit the current student body.
