# Learning About Markdown

### Q. What is Markdown?
>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. -[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

A. The above quote is from a website dedicated to learning Markdown, but if I had to paraphrase (potentially incorrectly), it is simply a language text files can use to change their formats.

### Q. Why do We Use Markdown?

A. According to the aforementioned website, there are many reasons as to why someone might use Markdown. The two that io recognized as being especially useful were;
1. It's entirely universal. You can utilize Markdown on all operating systems, and from anywhere you can open a text file.
2. It's "Future-Proof". Even if the text editor you normally use stops working, any other text editor will be able to read and allow you to edit the same file.

### Q. What Symbol will Create a Heading in Markdown?

A. To create any heading in Markdown, you have to use the pound symbol (#).  

To create the largest heading possible with Markdown, you use one pound symbol followed by the text you wish to make the heading. (see the below example)

Ex.
> This syntax ( # Example Heading" ) will produce the heading below:
>  # Example Heading
>

If you increase the number of pound symbols in succession, you will get samller and smaller headings. You can have a total of 6 pound symbols in succession.

Ex.
> This syntax (###### Small Heading) results in this heading:
> ###### Small Heading
>
Helpful reminder (at least to me): Don't forget the space after your pound symbols. You'll just end up with a bunch of pound symbols

Ex.
> This syntax ( ####Heading Without Space) has this result:
> 
> ####Heading Without Space
>

### Q. How do you emphasize text through the use of **bold** or *italics*?

A. There are two ways to bold of italicize text. 

To italicize text, you need to add a ( * ) or ( _ ) before and after the text you want italicized.

Ex.
> This syntax ( * Slanted * ) will result in *Slanted* when I remove the the spaces between the text and (*)
